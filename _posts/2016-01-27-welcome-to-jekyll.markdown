I have a new boss at work. He started about a month ago. The one before him left about a year ago. It took
that long to find a replacement. In the meantime the boss of the boss was acting as the boss. I did not get along
too well with him. That is why I was not particularly surprised when the new boss, after spending two week in his 
position suggested that I might be better off looking for a job somewhere else. 

The organization that I am working for is responsible for the develoment of certain applications among other things.
The development is mainly done by contractors, the employees are primarily focused on managing the contracts 
and following the projects. Being a software developer, it was clear from the first day that I started working 
there that this is not the ideal place for me. Still, I managed to stay for more than 5 years now, probably 
because the salary was good enough and I could deal with the things that I wanted to. 

I was asked to decide if I want to stay at my current employer and completely give up software development or 
leave the secure income and benefits and go for some new adventures. I was given some time to come back with an answer
but I feel that there was never really a question at all. I have been enthusiastic about computers since I 
got my first Commodore 64 about 25 something years ago and I cannot think of any reason why that would change
anytime soon. 

So here I go, looking for what to do next. I could just look for another "regular" job but I am not quite 
convinced to do so. Looking back at the jobs I have had so far, I could not actually pick any of them that I 
particularly enjoyed more than the others. I do not expect that the next one could bring any significant change 
in this trend. I was considering other options, like taking a break for a few months or even a year,
travelling around for a while, taking a remote job, starting an own project like a game or an app or a website, or
doing some combination of these. But I could not get to convince myself so I took a step back to try to find out
what I would actually like to achieve. I figured that programming keeps me quite happy. I enjoy putting the 
pieces together, figuring out stuff, and watching it do what it was meant to do. Good, I want to develop
software, let's go with that. I also want to do other things, like eat and sleep and relax and go out and visit places
and similar stuff that people normally do.
